  <p>&lt;Jean-Paul Pitman &amp; login: jc151985&gt; </p>
  
<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
  <p>The new website's goal is to increase lead generation by 50%, while also maintaing Training Zone's existing customer base</p>
  
  <h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>Tracking the increase in sales contacts generated by the website is crutial to proving the effectivness of the website.</p>
<p>To this end, a HTML 5 Webform will capture all requests for contact generated by the website. All requests will be loged for recordkeeping before being emailed to the client for actioning.</p>

<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>Training Zone has identified the target audience as 28-30, Mature Age job-seekers.</p>
<p>The mature Age Jobseeker is not a digital native. As a result, the new website will be designed for maximumm ease of access.</p>
<p> For example, Research has shown Menus that feature an icon instead of text increase ambiguity and confuse the non-digital natives. The notorious 'hamburger icon' will not be making an appearance.</p>
<p>Flexiable layouts will be used to ensure the site can be accessed from a multitude of devices.</p>
