<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
  <p>Build a custom website designed to increase new lead generation and assist in maintaing existing customer base for the Face to Face training specialists 'Training Zone'. </p>
  
  <h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>Tracking the increase in sales contacts generated by the website is crutial to proving the effectivness of the website.</p>
<p>To this end, a customized Webform will be a prominant feature of the Website design</p>


<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>Training Zone has identified the target audience as 28-30, Mature Age job-seekers.</p>
<p>The mature Age Jobseeker is not a digital native. As a result, the new website will be designed for maximumm ease of access.</p>
<p> For example, Research has shown Menus that feature an icon instead of text increase ambiguity and confuse the non digital natives. The notorious 'hamburger icon' will not be making an appearance.</p>
